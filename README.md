Every module is single module which we have to run alone because was unable to link.
It consists of 4 python files such as : admin.py,menu.py,user.py,weather.py and a text file consisting of JSON data data.txt.
For admin.py it consists of admin panel whose ID is admin and password is admin@123 its just a login for admin that has an inbuilt password.
For menu.py it consists of user management file which was to linked with admin but i was unable to do but if we run menu.py alone it will give you all the operations that were asked to do.
For user.py it just consists all the function that are being performed in menu.py it was created so that the structure of the code is well maintained.
For weather.py it shows us the weather data by giving the city name .
All the modules are not inter linked thats the only operation that i was unable to do .
